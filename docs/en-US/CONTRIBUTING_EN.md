#### Bug Reports

**‚úÖ Excellent bug report example:**
```markdown
Title: [Bug] Canvas animation stuttering during emotion input causing browser crash

**Problem Description**
When rapidly inputting multiple emotion words consecutively, the DynamicEmoji component's Canvas animation experiences severe stuttering, ultimately causing Firefox browser tab crash.

**Environment Information**
- Operating System: Windows 11 (22H2)
- Browser: Firefox 119.0.1
- Node.js: v18.17.0
- Project Version: v1.2.3

**Reproduction Steps**
1. Open application homepage
2. Quickly input "happy" in emotion input box
3. Immediately delete and input "sad"
4. Repeat steps 2-3 about 10 times
5. Observe Canvas area stuttering
6. Continue operations for about 30 seconds until browser tab crashes

**Expected Behavior**
Canvas animation should switch smoothly without causing performance issues or browser crashes

**Actual Behavior**
- Canvas animation frame rate significantly drops
- Browser memory usage continuously increases
- Eventually causes tab crash

**Additional Information**
- Similar issues occur in Chrome and Safari but don't crash
- Developer tools show memory usage growing from 50MB to 500MB+
- Console shows multiple "requestAnimationFrame callback" errors
```

**‚ùå Poor bug report example:**
```markdown
Title: Animation has issues

Page animation is stuck, please fix.
Browser: Firefox
```

#### Feature Requests

**‚úÖ Excellent feature request example:**
```markdown
Title: [Feature] Add music playback history and personalized recommendation learning

**Feature Description**
Hope to add user music playback history functionality and improve personalized recommendation algorithm based on historical data.

**Problem/Need Background**
Current recommendation system only considers current emotion state, doesn't account for user's long-term music preferences. User feedback hopes system can "remember" their music taste and provide more accurate recommendations.

**Detailed Requirements**
1. Playback History
   - Record played songs, duration, skip time points
   - Record emotion state labels during playback
   - Provide history viewing interface

2. Preference Learning Algorithm
   - Analyze user music preference patterns under different emotions
   - Learn music features users like/skip
   - Judge user preference based on playback completion rate

**Use Cases**
- Users often listen to classical music in "relaxed" state, system should prioritize classical recommendations
- Long-term users want to view their music taste evolution trends

**Technical Implementation Suggestions (Optional)**
- Use IndexedDB to store playback history
- Implement machine learning algorithms to analyze user preferences
- Consider privacy protection, provide data clearing options

**Priority**: Medium
```

**‚ùå Poor feature request example:**
```markdown
Title: Add history feature

Can you add history records?
```

## Code Quality Suggestions

To maintain project stability, we very much hope to get your help in ensuring code quality.

### Existing Tool Support

The project currently has the following tools configured to help maintain code quality:

#### ESLint Code Checking
```bash
npm run lint    # Check code standards and auto-fix
```

If you're willing, you can run this before committing to help find potential code issues.

#### Prettier Code Formatting
```bash

```

This tool helps maintain consistent code style, you can use it if convenient.

### Testing Suggestions

Since the project currently doesn't have automated testing configured (this is our shortcoming), we would be very grateful if you could help with some manual testing:

#### Basic Functionality Verification
- Whether new features work as expected
- Whether existing functionality is affected
- Whether it displays normally in your commonly used browsers

#### If possible, we also hope you could test
- Mobile display effects (if you have devices)
- Canvas animation effects for different emotion inputs
- Whether there are obvious console errors

### Our Plans

We're considering adding the following testing tools. If you have experience or interest, we very much welcome your suggestions or help:

- Unit testing framework (possibly Vitest)
- E2E testing tools (possibly Cypress)
- Automated performance monitoring
